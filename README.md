# FRC_Swerve
This the swerve drive code for team 8029. We are using a neo and falcon module, with neo steering and falcon controlling the speed. We are using a CANCoder  as the absolute encoder. 


This is currenty in progress. I am going to add more refinement so that I can use a joystick to control, using a pigeon sensor for optometry, and finally add two speed states. 


This two speed states will icnlude a first speed that goes from 0 to 60 percent of full speed. The second speed with use an extra button, that when held, it will raise the threshold of 60 percent, therefore, allowing full speed driving. 

**This is not finished**
